// Data Types overview

/* Built in data types:
  - Numbers (int, double)
  - String (String) 
  - Booleans (bool)
  - Lists (List, also known as array)
  - Sets (Set)
  - Maps (Map)
  - The value null (Null)
  - Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
  - Symbols (Symbol)
  
  Note: 
  - these data types also have built in attributes or methods
  - will look at example attribute call and method call
  
*/

// when u declare a variable in dart, and the do variablename.
// intellisense will show u all attribute and methods available
// with that data type

// void main(){
//   var s1 = 'This is a string';
//   print(s1);
// //   print(s1.);  
// }

/* But what is the difference between an attribute and a method

-- Attribute
- It is a piece of information or data about the instance.
- For example, length of a string var

-- Method
- A method performs some actions on the object
- It often retuns a new object, for example a uppoer or lower case
    version of a string.

Note: many methods won't transform an object 'in-place', meaning 
  the original variable remains unchanged annd an assignment must
  be used. But u can change original object if u do object = object.method;

To differentiate attribute and method, attributes usually dont have
a parenthisis call.

  print(myName);  //methods dont transform original object
                  // and u can assign transform to other object
  var upperName = myName.toUpperCase();
  print(upperName);
